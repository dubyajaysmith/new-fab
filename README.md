# New Fab (WIP)

## A work in progress building of a new tab page taking advantage of web components

Building out first components I'd like for work and projects using native web component's new v1 spec.

### State

* Still lots todo
* Project component (and it's components) is about there
* Want to tackle bookmark & history next
* also build out [backend](https://github.com/dubyajaysmith/new-fab-service "backend") to sync along with chrome syncs
