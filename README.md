# New Fab

## A new tab extension

Building out initial web-components (WCs) using v1 spec I'd like for work & projects

### State

#### There

* Project components are about there

#### Not There

* Started: bookmark component(s). When that's done web store listing can go out of private
* Do-able: A small [backend](https://github.com/dubyajaysmith/new-fab-service) to sync when chrome syncs if wanted => login thru Settings to sync firefox, chrome, mobile
* Moonshot: replace small express backend for [Solid](https://github.com/solid/) if/when viable
* Moonshot: load WC views built for it through Settings with additional permissons under optional in manifest to ask for
