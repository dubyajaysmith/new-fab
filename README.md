# work-watch (WIP)

## Another stab at building a decent time keeper

### What's that mean

Very WIP but I've used & made various timers and nothing has made me happy so far ðŸ˜ž

Building a chrome extension to auto track active time spent on SalesForce orgs / URIs to build upon and try again ðŸ˜„

Next, I'd like to make another VS Code extention to compliment this once data is there to combine ðŸ¤“
